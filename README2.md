## **Road Accident Dashboard Report**

### **Project Title:**

**Road Accident Analysis Dashboard**

### **Objective:**

The primary objective of this dashboard is to analyze road accident data to identify patterns, high-risk zones, causes of accidents, and trends over time to support safety improvements and informed decision-making by authorities.

---

### **Key Insights and Visuals from the Dashboard**

#### üõ£Ô∏è **1. Total Number of Accidents**

* **Metric Used:** Count of `Accident_Index`
* **Insight:** Displays the total number of road accidents recorded in the dataset.
* **Purpose:** Provides an overall scale of road safety concerns within the time frame.

#### üìç **2. Accident Locations**

* **Visual Type:** Map visualization or Clustered Bar Chart
* **Metric Used:** Count of accidents by `Location` or `Police_Force`
* **Insight:** Highlights high-risk zones with the highest frequency of accidents.
* **Purpose:** Assists in resource allocation for traffic management and safety improvement.

#### üïí **3. Time and Date Trends**

* **Visual Type:** Line or Area Chart
* **Metrics Used:** Accidents over `Date` or `Time`
* **Insight:** Shows trends in accident frequency across months or hours.
* **Purpose:** Identifies peak times or seasons for accidents, useful for targeted interventions.

#### üöó **4. Vehicle Types Involved**

* **Visual Type:** Pie Chart / Bar Chart
* **Metric Used:** Count of accidents by `Vehicle_Type`
* **Insight:** Identifies which types of vehicles are most often involved in accidents.
* **Purpose:** Helps in creating targeted awareness campaigns.

#### üí• **5. Casualty Severity**

* **Visual Type:** Stacked Column Chart or KPI Card
* **Metric Used:** Distribution of accidents by `Casualty_Severity`
* **Insight:** Breaks down the number of fatal, serious, and slight injuries.
* **Purpose:** Highlights the impact level and necessity for emergency services.

#### üö¶ **6. Contributing Factors**

* **Visual Type:** Bar Chart
* **Metric Used:** Top causes like `Weather_Conditions`, `Road_Surface_Conditions`, or `Light_Conditions`
* **Insight:** Shows contributing conditions during accidents.
* **Purpose:** Supports infrastructure improvement and public education.

### **Conclusions and Recommendations**

1. **High-Risk Zones**: Focus on accident-prone areas such as major metropolitan zones for traffic monitoring and road condition improvements.
2. **Time-Based Interventions**: Reinforce traffic regulations during peak accident times (e.g., evenings and weekends).
3. **Vehicle-Specific Campaigns**: Promote road safety awareness for car drivers, as they represent a high percentage of involvement.
4. **Weather and Lighting**: Improve infrastructure such as street lighting and drainage in areas prone to poor visibility or wet road surfaces.
5. **Age-Specific Messaging**: Launch tailored education programs for vulnerable age groups identified in the data.

Would you like this formatted into a **PowerPoint** or **PDF report** with visuals, or do you want a **Word document** style export? Also, I can extract exact numbers and charts from the `.pbix` file if you can open it in Power BI Desktop and export visuals or share screenshots. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
